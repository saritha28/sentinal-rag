# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the architectural decisions for SentinelRAG. We use the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format (Markdown Architectural Decision Records).

## Conventions

- Filenames: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md` (zero-padded, immutable once merged).
- Each ADR is **immutable** once accepted. To revise: write a new ADR that supersedes the old one and update the old ADR's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- ADRs are short on purpose — focused on one decision with clear trade-offs.
- Status values: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`, `Deprecated`.
- When an ADR overrides one of the design docs (`Enterprise_RAG_*.md`), call this out explicitly under "Notes on the design docs".
