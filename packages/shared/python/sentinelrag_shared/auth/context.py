"""AuthContext — the authoritative identity object passed through every request.

The auth middleware constructs an ``AuthContext`` after validating the JWT
and resolving the user's permissions from the database. Subsequent layers
(routes, services, repositories) read this instead of touching the JWT.

Note that the JWT's claims are *advisory* for everything except identity.
Permissions in particular are loaded from our DB (see ADR-0008) — Keycloak
roles in the JWT are ignored for authorization decisions.
