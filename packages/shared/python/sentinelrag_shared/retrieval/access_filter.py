"""AccessFilter — RBAC predicate builder applied at query time.

Architectural pillar (CLAUDE.md, ADR-0008): RBAC is enforced at retrieval
time, not post-retrieval mask. This module produces a SQL WHERE predicate
that BOTH the BM25 and vector queries apply BEFORE fetching candidates.

Three layers stack here:
    1. **Tenant isolation** — enforced by Postgres RLS via the session-bound
       ``app.current_tenant_id`` setting. The retriever sessions inherit
       this from the request middleware (see ``apps/api/app/db/session.py``).
    2. **Collection scope** — the user passes ``collection_ids`` in the query
       request; we add ``c.collection_id IN (:collection_ids)``.
    3. **Per-collection access policy** — the user must have at least
       read-level access (via role or direct grant) on each collection. We
       enforce this by joining ``collection_access_policies`` to the role
       set the active user holds.

The AccessFilter does NOT issue SQL itself — it returns a predicate fragment
+ parameter dict that the caller injects into its larger query. This keeps
the predicate composable (BM25's CTE and vector search's window can both
apply the same filter without duplicating the join logic).
