"""HybridRetriever — BM25 + vector with reciprocal rank fusion + dedupe.

Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is robust and parameter-light:

    rrf_score(d) = sum_i  1 / (k + rank_i(d))

with ``k=60`` recommended by Cormack/Lynam (2009). The constant smooths
extreme ranks; we don't tune per-query in v1.

Output ordering: by RRF score, descending. Each output Candidate carries
the BM25 + vector ranks in metadata so the trace UI can show which path
contributed.
